				  Early cross-browser compatibility development as a front-end engineer were lessons in problem solving, making the impossible possible by exploiting browser vulnerabilities through JS and CSS hacking. And intensive testing.

				  My flash actionscript experience was working closely to deliver interactive experiences through graphical animations and audio and video during the Web 2.0 era. Where video was new and bandwidth was still a major hurdle. A lesson in developing an eye for responsive behavior today.

				  Agency work - closely collaborating with product and design for visual and experience to come up with feasible technical solutions within the timeframe and budget.

				  Working with a variety of technologies sometimes determined by the client. Learning technologies fast and during development.

				  Provide innovative options and alternatives to enhance interactive experiences to promote client business set the user experience apart from the norm.

				  Rockstar Games

				  Freelance Independent Work managing myself, the client, working with the designer, managing timelines and expectations, determining budgets. Others included working with agencies or referral contacts.

				  Large-Scale Web Application Development for news media working in modular fashion on parts of applications that I may or may not own. Providing options and alternatives to fit within the existing infrastructure and codebase. Integrating templates.

				  As a senior or lead I expect certain responsibilities outside of my own coding duties.

				  It's my responsibility to provide feasible ongoing solutions and alternatives with design, product, and fellow engineers, estimate timelines and budgets, keep track of progress and adjust as necessary. Keep lines of communication open. And ensure project requirements, coding guidelines, and best practices are followed.

				  My focus is first and foremost be available. Then to listen and understand. Stay focused on the issue as diplomatically as possible. Offer my thoughts with as little advice or suggestions as possible. I believe it's important for an engineer to arrive at their approaches and ideas and be allowed to share them freely without judgement. Unless it doesn't adhere to the project requirements or engineering conventions. If something can stand to be improved I'd promote it if within reason.

				  I like to see things through. Or look for challenges or needs to fulfill. My job isn't done until it meets the goal. Then I move onto the next task.

				  I like to feel like I am making an impact or making progress.

				  I will switch roles as needed for practical reasons.

				  That there is commitment to success of the goal by all parties. Whether it be in the smallest task or the biggest ask.

				  In my down time I like to research and discover new tools. Or search for a tool that may fit a current need or benefit the process.

				  I enjoy trying to find a solution that works within the constraints of the codebase. The system. The app. The browser.

				  Practicing adhering to the conventions and guidelines. From tab spacing and variable naming to code structure and planning.

				  I like migration projects. Whether it be to implement a new technology to manage CSS files. Or to migrate from React to Vue.

				  No place is perfect. A system can always be perfected. What I look for is the above. Which makes the perfect application possible. Ultimately, what I'm looking for is a place where I can work towards this. And in turn, take that knowledge to create a new application.

				  The initiative. Business Intelligence.

				  Forge your own path.
				  While there are role models, mentors, inspiration. I believe it's important to find your own path. Your way. (While being a contributing and functioning member of society.)

				  Which is why I refrain from influencing. I'd rather share knowledge and experiences as diplomatically as possible.
				  Refrain from absolute opinions. Encourage objective thinking. Encourage someone to be themselves first and foremost. Approach things in a way that comes naturally first. And adjust from there. To reach for goals however menial or grand. Regardless of their appearance.

				  Encourage expression.

				  I'm not here to teach but to guide. While there is very tangible knowledge to be learned and specific ways in which they must be applied in engineering. I approach it through this perspective.

				  I will give you the answer, tell you what's wrong, or point you in the right direction.

				  Managing large scale global solutions and the new challenges that come with it. Whether it be inhabiting a new market to changing the way we do things. JPMC already has that vision. And is already in many markets. A project that should last for several years.

				  But before I can do that. I must learn my field. And fill in the last piece. Back-end and Software Engineering. And Fullstack Engineering is my entry point. The job search my hurdle. Interview Culture.

				  On the side it would be great to leverage the group, dept, company to give back as part of the social responsibility all must recognize. However small or large.

				  When I retire I'd like to start a shelter home for every senior dogs in shelters across the united states.

				  I like to keep learning how I can do my job better. I like keep applying my skills in different ways. I look for ways to improve my skills so that I can improve how a website can work. Whether it be how it looks, animates, or works.

				  How? Just do it.

				  I like staying productive. Doing something I enjoy doesn't have to mean there is a goal or a reason. I can enjoy just to enjoy with no further motive. But where possible I like to make it count somehow.

				  Research projects

				  But I am now also about balance. Not every aspect of my life is driven by improving. My main goal is finding what fits naturally.

				  I go through phases.

				  I enjoy finding ways to apply my experience in building UI, finding new ways to employ them, and searching for new technologies that could help bring these tech needs to life.

				  I not only like user interface design but I like user experience. And I like personalization and customization. Content or views that are the most relevant to a user at any given time during their experience. Whether they are logged in or are doing a search. That not only translates to how a user interacts with a website. But how I host a party. How I decorate my apartment. What I choose to wear to an interview or in a situation. All must reflect me as a person given the situation from who it is I'm meeting to the weather to the occasion. async

				  I believe this translates to user experience. Allowing a user to access what they want and when with a very nice enjoyable and also intuitive way is what I think makes a user experience or interface design successful.

				  My responsibilities as a front end engineer include not just how a page looks but how it works and how well it works.

				  Translating designs to the pixel, implementing functionality from external tools to building custom video players. And anything in between.

				  I am accustomed to working with modules in a large application to building sections of a site to building the entire site front to back. Where each may include different technologies, different structures, and different conventions.

				  I have implemented every type of user interface functionality out there or at least something similar.

				  It has given me a great eye for design, allowed me to better learn how my skills can be applied to better make these ideas a reality, and in turn allow the web application to meet business needs.

				  In an effort to hone my skills further as a front-end engineer to provide even better solutions for user experience and interface. I'd love to be able to approach front-end development from a software engineering view with modern web stack like those based in node. And translate my previous skills to this new environment.

				  I like to be thorough. My first priority is to define my role. Am I planning the

				  {/*<p>My background is in Front-End Development building multi-page applications with a variety of technologies. Primarily based around PHP and JSP related technologies and a vast arrays of data stores and endpoints.</p>*/}

				  {/*<p>This can vary by project and among companies. But in general it involves building UIs that are cross-browser/platform compatible and optimized using the templating engine of choice and data integration using anything from AJAX to PHP. It has also grown to include what is called fullstack engineering. That may require anything from me querying my own data to designing the database itself.</p>*/}

				  {/*<p>I am now looking to move from traditional MPA development into more modern application development that usually implies Single Page Applications on a Node-based or similar architecture. While still focusing on UI development. To me this can include anything from building the templates and modules themselves to querying my own data or even designing the database and how each communicate with each other.</p>*/}

				  {/*<p>There's an avalanche of stuff out there. All make for a wonderfully diverse idea world. A great way to see how people choose to apply something and how it's executed. But the key is in making it relevant. And relevant to current needs. The industry has gone from severely limited options and non-standardized contraints. To more standardized constraints like browser support for the latest CSS and JS and a deluge of tech options out there. All of which can be combined in a myriad of ways to either make for an effectively designed application or a frankenstein of technical debt. The potential is out there to make the most elegant of applications in both form and function. But the*/}

				  {/*<p>While I love exploring and prototyping and am always looking for the next best tech solution to fit my needs, my utlimate goal is to be able to make the best strategic decisions and approaches not only at the code-level but at the application architecture level. Within this current incarnation of application engineering. I not only consider how best to code up a template and how the page loads to how to best write the javascript but also what constraints current site and application have.</p>*/}

				  {/*<p>I have my own opinions. But always prefer to first learn and understand the current situation. In order to make the best informed decision possible. Which means everything is always up for debate. As long as it is relevant and has clearly defined reasoning. I value transparency and continuous re-assessment.
